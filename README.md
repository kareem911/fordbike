Our target audience is a employee between 20 and 40 years old who prefer riding a bike to their workplace and back 
home. We expect high number of rides on weekdays specially at 8 am and 5 pm. We need to make sure that bikes
are enough during the surge. We need to specialize marketing campaigns targeting females to encourage them to
use our services more often. Promo codes could be offered on weekends to increase our exposure.
